# Structure:
## Part 1 Analysis with visualisations :
distributions for each species of penguins' bill length

## Part 2 Summary statistics
mean, median and skewness for each species of penguins' bill length

## Part 3 Hypothesis test
Performed hypothesis test to check whether the mean bill length
of Gentoo is significantly longer than the mean bill length of Adelie.

## Part 4 Creating a correlation matrix
Created a correlation matrix that shows the correlation between
bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass across species

## Comments
Each sections also have comments that states the findings.
