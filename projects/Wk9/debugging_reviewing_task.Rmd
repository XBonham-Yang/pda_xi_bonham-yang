For these tasks will be using the dataset `energy_scotland.csv` which contains data on the energy production for different sectors in Scotland over time, and `all_salaries.csv` which contains information on employees in a company. 


```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
energy_scotland <- read_csv("data/energy_scotland.csv")
energy_scotland
```

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
all_salaries <- read_csv("data/all_salaries.csv")
all_salaries
```

# Task 1

Goal: return the row in the data which has the maximum energy production, making sure the code would work if new data was added to the dataset. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
max(energy_scotland$energy_prod)
# this returns value 25165.9 

energy_scotland %>%
  filter(energy_prod == 25165.9)
```


This code runs but not very efficient, I am going to change it so it will
use one step and the code can be reused for different data sets

# Answer 1
```{r, eval = FALSE}
energy_scotland %>%
  filter(energy_prod == max(energy_prod))
```






# Task 2

Goal: create a new column called 'rating' to the energy table which will take the following values in the table. The bins should be inclusive of the upper value e.g. is the energy production is 20,000 exactly then will be 'high', if it's 10,000 exactly then will be 'medium', etc. 

| lower energy production | upper energy production | rating    |   
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| 20000                   |                         | very high |   
| 10000                   | 20000                   | high      |  
| 5000                    | 10000                   | medium    |  
| 2000                    | 5000                    | low       |   
|                         | 2000                    | very low  | 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rating <- if_else(energy_scotland$energy_prod > 20000, "very high", if_else(energy_scotland$energy_prod > 10000 & energy_scotland$energy_prod <= 20000, "high", if_else(energy_scotland$energy_prod > 5000 & energy_scotland$energy_prod <= 10000, "medium", if_else(energy_scotland$energy_prod > 2000 & energy_scotland$energy_prod <= 5000, "low", "very low"))))

energy_scotland_rating <- bind_cols(energy_scotland, rating = rating)
```
This code runs but very long and complicatied. I will mutate the data set
we already have and use case when. 
if_else works greatly if there's only two conditions to check, case_when can handle 
more in a clear way. 
# Answer 2

```{r,eval = FALSE}
energy_scotland_rating <- energy_scotland %>% 
  mutate(rating = case_when(energy_prod > 20000 ~ "very high",
                           energy_prod > 10000 ~ "high",
                           energy_prod > 5000 ~ "medium",
                           energy_prod > 2000 ~ "low",
                           TRUE ~ "very low"))
```


# Task 3

Goal: create a plot which shows how the energy production for the sectors renewables, gas and pumped hydro compare over time.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
renewable <- energy_scotland %>%
  filter(sector == "Renewables")

gas <- energy_scotland %>%
  filter(sector == "Gas")

hydro <- energy_scotland %>%
  filter(sector == "Pumped hydro")

years <- unique(energy_scotland$year)

ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = energy_prod,  color = sector), data = renewable) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = energy_prod, color = sector), data = gas) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = energy_prod, color = sector), data = hydro) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = years) +
  labs(title = "Energy production in Scotland over time split by sector", x ="Year", y = "Energy production")
```
This code runs but very complicated, I will use the data set we already have to 
plot instead of creating new data frames.

# Answer 3

```{r, eval = FALSE}
energy_scotland %>%
  filter(sector %in% c("Renewables", "Gas", "Pumped hydro")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, energy_prod)) +
  geom_line(aes(col = sector)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = years) +
  labs(title = "Energy production in Scotland over time split by sector", x ="Year", y = "Energy production", 
       col = "Sector")
```





# Task 4

Goal: calculate the average energy production for the Coal, Gas, and Oil sectors across the time period in the data.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
energy_scotland %>%
  filter(sector == c("Coal", "Gas", "Oil")) %>%
  group_by(sector) %>%
  summarise(avg_energy_prod = mean(energy_prod))
```
This code missed a lot of rows of data by using == in filter
== checks if two things are the same, %in% checks if first thing is contained 
in the second thing 

# Answer 4 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
energy_scotland %>%
  filter(sector %in% c("Coal", "Gas", "Oil")) %>%
  group_by(sector) %>%
  summarise(avg_energy_prod = mean(energy_prod))
```



# Task 5 

```{r, eval = TRUE}
student <- tibble(
  Name = c("Brian", "David", "Karen"),
  age = c(25, 56, 40),
  location = c("Scotland", "England", "scotland"),
  `email address` = c("briang@yahoo.co.uk", "dsmith@gmail.co.uk", "karen")
)

student
```
Goal: clean up this tibble by only returning the name, location and email address information, putting the location information into lowercase and also creating a new column called `valid_email` to have values `TRUE` or `FALSE` whether the email address is valid. Here our definition is valid is that it contains an `@` symbol followed by a combination of lowercase characters or a `.` symbol.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
student %>%
  select(name, location, email_address) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  str_to_lower(location) 
  mutate(valid_email = str_detect(email_address, "@a-z.")
```
This code doesn't run at all, they used the clean names 
before the names were in the clean form, 
didn't use mutate to change the location column
missing %>% 
the regx used was wrong, a-z needs to be in [] for all letter from a to z 

# Answer 5 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
student %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(name, location, email_address) %>%
  mutate(location = str_to_lower(location)) %>% 
  mutate(valid_email = str_detect(email_address, "@[a-z.]"))
```
# Task 6

Goal: create a function to work on the all_salaries dataframe (or a similar dataframe that has a column `salary` and `job_area`). The function should take in the dataframe (`dataframe_input`) and a job area (`job_area_input`) and a salary value (`salary_input`). The function should only return the employees in the dataframe that have a salary above this value `salary_input` and who work in job area `job_area_input`. For example if `job_area_input` was 'Legal' and `salary_input` was 30000 then the function would return the following output:

![](images/desired_function_output.png)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
subsetting_salaries <- function(dataframe_input,job_area_input,salary_input){ 
  data <- dataframe_input %>% select(job_area) %>% filter(job_area == job_area_input)
  data1 <- data[data$savings > salary_input, ]
}

subsetting_salaries(CodeClanData::all_salaries, Human Resources, 30000)
```
This code used some bad names, no returns of the function, inputs are in wrong type
assigned data and data1 but returns nothing, input should be a string, R doesn't
recognize words without "" as strings， 
for the wrong function, in data, it selected only job_area, so for data1, it won't give you anything 
Used Saving to compare instead of salary as the question asked for.
# Answer 6 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
subsetting_salaries <- function(dataframe_input,job_area_input,salary_input){
  
 dataframe_input %>% filter(job_area == job_area_input, 
                            salary > salary_input)
}

subsetting_salaries(all_salaries, "Human Resources", 30000)
```
