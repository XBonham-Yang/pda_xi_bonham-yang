1. Exploratory analysis
Explore the dataset using visualisations, and keep in mind the question youâ€™re trying to answer above.

Write a short summary of the results.
```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
library(e1071)
library(infer)
penguins <- palmerpenguins::penguins 
```

```{r}
summary(penguins)
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(species,bill_length_mm))+
  geom_boxplot(aes(colour = species))+
  geom_jitter(aes(colour = species), alpha = 0.5)
```
```
from the graph above, chinstrap has the longest bill and 
adelie has the shortest. gentoo and chinstrap looks very similar. with in each 
species, the distribution seems normal.
```

2. Summary statistics
Calculate the following summary statistics to describe bill length for each species:

measures of centrality (mean & median)
spread (standard deviation)
skewness (you can use the skewness() function from the e1071 package)
Write a short summary of the results.

4.4 Summary statistics including measures of centrality, spread and skewness
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(mean_bill = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            median = median(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            skewness = skewness(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE, type = 1)
            )
```
```
from the table above, the average bill_lenght matachs with the box_plot(Chinstrap has the longest then gentoo and adelie),
adelie and gentoo, chinstrp and adelie are symmtric,
and gentoo are moderately right skewed 
```


3. Hypothesis test & probability
Perform a suitable hypothesis test to check whether the mean bill length of Gentoo is significantly longer than the mean bill length of Adelie.

Visualise the p-value on the null distribution.
Write an interpretation of your findings.


4.1 Exploratory data analysis and targeted data analysis (hypothesis testing)
4.3 Probability and probability distributions

My Null(H0) and alternative(H1) hypothesis as below, my alpha level is 0.05
$$
N0: \mu_{gentoo\ bill\ length} = \mu_{adelie\ bill\ length} \\
N1: \mu_{gentoo\ bill\ length} > \mu_{adelie\ bill\ length}
$$


```{r}
null_distribution <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species %in% c("Adelie", "Gentoo")) %>% 
  specify(bill_length_mm ~ species) %>% 
  hypothesise(null = 'independence') %>% 
  generate(rep = 1000, type = 'permute') %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c('Gentoo', 'Adelie'))

null_distribution
```



```{r}
observed_stats <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species %in% c("Adelie", "Gentoo")) %>% 
  specify(bill_length_mm ~ species) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c('Gentoo', 'Adelie'))

observed_stats 
```
```{r}
null_distribution %>% 
  visualise()+
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stats, direction = "right")
```
```{r}
p_value <- null_distribution %>% 
  get_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stats, direction = "right")
p_value
```
```
p_value is how likely it is to see a result as extreme as observed result, if the null hypothesus is true.
we got p_value < 0.0001, this means it's not very likely to see a dataset such as ours, if the HO is true. 
It is a lot less than our alpha level, 
the difference is significant and we reject H0 and 
found evidence to support H1. 
```
