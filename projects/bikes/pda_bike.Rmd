What is the pattern of bike hires over time (e.g. within a year, month, week, or day)?
Do bike hire patterns differ between bike rider demographics? (e.g. gender, type of trip, age)
Any other insights?

You will probably want to use the data in column start_time to create date, month and year columns.
Summarising the data by aggregating hire counts by different measures of time (e.g. year, quarter, month, day) and then visualising the results is probably a good idea
When grouping time series data (tsibble), you need to use index_by instead of group_by
```{r}
nyc_bikes_short <- nyc_bikes_df %>% 
  select(start_time, stop_time, birth_year, gender, type) %>% 
  mutate(year = year(start_time),
         month = month(start_time, label = TRUE),
         day = as.Date(start_time),
         wday  = wday(start_time,label = TRUE),
         week = week(start_time),
         time_ride = stop_time - start_time,
         age = as.numeric(year - birth_year))
nyc_bikes_short
```

We're mid-way through Women's Bike Month! october
Did you know only a quarter of all bike trips in the U.S. are taken by women? At Citi Bike, we're dedicated to changing this. 
This month we're giving all new riders their first trip free using code GIRLUP18, and donating $1 from each of these rides to Girl Up's SchoolCycle program to help provide bikes to girls around the world so they can safely access education.
Join us in encouraging more ladies to get on bikes and give back to a great cause while doing it. 



```{r}

 nyc_bikes_df %>% 
  mutate(week = week(start_time)) %>% 
  filter(week == 4) %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(
    lng = ~end_long,
    lat = ~end_lat,
    clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions()
  )
