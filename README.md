<i> This repo has all my SQA Projects. </i>
<h3> Penguin </h3>
<p> This project focused on Hypothesis test and creating visulisations using ggplot. </p>
<h3> Start_up </h3>
<p> This is the first project, practised analysis using tidyvise and machine learning. I built and interprated a decision tree model </p>
<h3> Wk9 </h3>
<p> This week I had two mini projects, debuging and transforming data. I had to spot and change the code so it runs or improve the codes. I cleaned and joined 
tables together and created a relationship graph. 
<h3> Bikes </h3>
<p> This project used data from CitiBike. It answered business questions and provided visualisations. It worked with time series data and created spacial graphs too. Reports and presentation were presented at the end with action insights suggested by data.
I used Leaflet to present spacial graphs, and ggplot2 to create statistic graphs. I provided trends for each week/weekday/month for different demographics. 
I did a lot of exploring with the data and created many draft graphs to pick out most valuable ones to answer the questions. </p>
